    In the 16th century, an age of great marine and terrestrial exploration,
    Ferdinand Magellan led the first expedition to sail around the world. As a
    young Portuguese noble, he served the king of Portugal, but he became
    involved in the quagmire of political intrigue at court and lost the king’s
    favor. After he was dismissed from service by the king of Portugal, he
    offered to serve the future Emperor Charles V of Spain.<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A papal decree of 1493 had
    assigned all land in the New World west of 50 degrees W longitude to Spain
    and all the land east of that line to Portugal. Magellan offered to prove
    that the East Indies fell under Spanish authority.On September 20, 1519,
    Magellan set sail from Spain with five ships. More than a year later, one of
    these ships was exploring the topography of South America in search of a
    water route across the continent. This ship sank, but the remaining four
    ships searched along the southern peninsula of South America. Finally they
    found the passage they sought near 50 degrees S latitude. Magellan named
    this passage the Strait of All Saints, but today it is known as the Strait
    of Magellan.<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One ship deserted while in
    this passage and returned to Spain, so fewer sailors were privileged to gaze
    at that first panorama of the Pacific Ocean. Those who remained crossed the
    meridian now known as the International Date Line in the early spring of
    1521 after 98 days on the Pacific Ocean. During those long days at sea, many
    of Magellan’s men died of starvation and disease.

    <em>A short story by O. Henry</em><br />
    <p>
      In the northern part of Austin there once dwelt an honest family by the
      name of Smothers. The family consisted of John Smothers, his wife,
      himself, their little daughter, five years of age, and her parents, making
      six people toward the population of the city when counted for a special
      write-up, but only three by actual count. One night after supper the
      little girl was seized with a severe colic, and John Smothers hurried down
      town to get some medicine.He never came back. The little girl recovered
      and in time grew up to womanhood.The mother grieved very much over her
      husband's disappearance, and it was nearly three months before she married
      again, and moved to San Antonio.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little girl also married in time, and after a few years had rolled
      around, she also had a little girl five years of age. She still lived in
      the same house where they dwelt when her father had left and never
      returned. One night by a remarkable coincidence her little girl was taken
      with cramp colic on the anniversary of the disappearance of John Smothers,
      who would now have been her grandfather if he had been alive and had a
      steady job. "I will go downtown and get some medicine for her," said John
      Smith (for it was none other than he whom she had married). "No, no, dear
      John," cried his wife. "You, too, might disappear forever, and then forget
      to come back." So John Smith did not go, and together they sat by the
      bedside of little Pansy (for that was Pansy's name). After a little Pansy
      seemed to grow worse, and John Smith again attempted to go for medicine,
      but his wife would not let him. Suddenly the door opened, and an old man,
      stooped and bent, with long white hair, entered the room. "Hello, here is
      grandpa," said Pansy. She had recognized him before any of the others. The
      old man drew a bottle of medicine from his pocket and gave Pansy a
      spoonful. She got well immediately. "I was a little late," said John
      Smothers, "as I waited for a street car."

    <h3><a id="item2">The Disciple</a></h3>
    <em>A short story by Oscar Wilde</em><br />
    <p>
      When Narcissus died the pool of his pleasure changed from a cup of sweet
      waters into a cup of salt tears, and the Oreads came weeping through the
      woodland that they might sing to the pool and give it comfort. And when
      they saw that the pool had changed from a cup of sweet waters into a cup
      of salt tears, they loosened the green tresses of their hair and cried to
      the pool and said, `We do not wonder that you should mourn in this manner
      for Narcissus, so beautiful was he.' `But was Narcissus beautiful?' said
      the pool.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Who should know that better than you?' answered the Oreads. `Us did he
      ever pass by, but you he sought for, and would lie on your banks and look
      down at you, and in the mirror of your waters he would mirror his own
      beauty.' And the pool answered, `But I loved Narcissus because, as he lay
      on my banks and looked down at me, in the mirror of his eyes I saw ever my
      own beauty mirrored.'

    <h3><a id="item3"> Aged Mother</a>The</h3>
    <em>A short story by Matsuo Basho</em><br />
    <p>
      Long, long ago there lived at the foot of the mountain a poor farmer and
      his aged, widowed mother. They owned a bit of land which supplied them
      with food, and they were humble, peaceful, and happy. Shining was governed
      by a despotic leader who though a warrior, had a great and cowardly
      shrinking from anything suggestive of failing health and strength. This
      caused him to send out a cruel proclamation. The entire province was given
      strict orders to immediately put to death all aged people. Those were
      barbarous days, and the custom of abandoning old people to die was not
      uncommon. The poor farmer loved his aged mother with tender reverence, and
      the order filled his heart with sorrow. But no one ever thought twice
      about obeying the mandate of the governor, so with many deep and hopeless
      sighs, the youth prepared for what at that time was considered the kindest
      mode of death. Just at sundown, when his day’s work was ended, he took a
      quantity of unwhitened rice which was the principal food for the poor, and
      he cooked, dried it, and tied it in a square cloth, which he swung in a
      bundle around his neck along with a gourd filled with cool, sweet water.
      Then he lifted his helpless old mother to his back and started on his
      painful journey up the mountain. The road was long and steep; the narrow
      road was crossed and re-crossed by many paths made by the hunters and
      woodcutters. In some place, they lost and confues, but he gave no heed.
      One path or another, it mattered not. On he went, climbing blindly upward
      -- ever upward towards the high bare summit of what is known as
      Obatsuyama, the mountain of the “abandoning of the aged.” The eyes of the
      old mother were not so dim but that they noted the reckless hastening from
      one path to another, and her loving heart grew anxious. Her son did not
      know the mountain’s many paths and his return might be one of danger, so
      she stretched forth her hand and snapping the twigs from brushes as they
      passed, she quietly dropped a handful every few steps of the way so that
      as they climbed, the narrow path behind them was dotted at frequent
      intervals with tiny piles of twigs. At last the summit was reached. Weary
      and heart sick, the youth gently released his burden and silently prepared
      a place of comfort as his last duty to the loved one. Gathering fallen
      pine needles, he made a soft cushion and tenderly lifted his old mother
      onto it. Hew rapped her padded coat more closely about the stooping
      shoulders and with tearful eyes and an aching heart he said farewell.
    </p>
    <p>
      The trembling mother’s voice was full of unselfish love as she gave her
      last injunction. “Let not thine eyes be blinded, my son.” She said. “The
      mountain road is full of dangers. LOOK carefully and follow the path which
      holds the piles of twigs. They will guide you to the familiar path farther
      down.” The son’s surprised eyes looked back over the path, then at the
      poor old, shriveled hands all scratched and soiled by their work of love.
      His heart broke within and bowing to the ground, he cried aloud: “oh,
      Honorable mother, your kindness breaks my heart! I will not leave you.
      Together we will follow the path of twigs, and together we will die!” Once
      more he shouldered his burden (how light it seemed now) and hastened down
      the path, through the shadows and the moonlight, to the little hut in the
      valley. Beneath the kitchen floor was a walled closet for food, which was
      covered and hidden from view. There the son hid his mother, supplying her
      with everything she needed, continually watching and fearing she would be
      discovered. Time passed, and he was beginning to feel safe when again the
      governor sent forth heralds bearing an unreasonable order, seemingly as a
      boast of his power. His demand was that his subjects should present him
      with a rope of ashes. The entire province trembled with dread. The order
      must be obeyed yet who in all Shining could make a rope of ashes? One
      night, in great distress, the son whispered the news to his hidden mother.
      “Wait!” she said. “I will think. I will think” On the second day she told
      him what to do. “Make rope of twisted straw,” she said. “Then stretch it
      upon a row of flat stones and burn it on a windless night.” He called the
      people together and did as she said and when the blaze died down, there
      upon the stones, with every twist and fiber showing perfectly, lay a rope
      of ashes. The governor was pleased at the wit of the youth and praised
      greatly, but he demanded to know where he had obtained his wisdom. “Alas!
      Alas!” cried the farmer, “the truth must be told!” and with deep bows he
      related his story. The governor listened and then meditated in silence.
      Finally he lifted his head. “Shining needs more than strength of youth,”
      he said gravely. “Ah, that I should have forgotten the well-known saying,
      “with the crown of snow, there cometh wisdom!” That very hour the cruel
      law was abolished, and custom drifted into as far a past that only legends
      remain.

    <h3><a id="item4">The Star Lovers</a></h3>
    <em>A short story by Grace James</em><br />
    <p>
      All you that are true lovers, I beseech you pray the gods for fair weather
      upon the seventh night of the seventh moon. For patience’s sake and for
      dear love’s sake, pray, and be pitiful that upon that night there may be
      neither rain, nor hail, nor cloud, nor thunder, nor creeping mist. Hear
      the sad tale of the Star Lovers and give them your prayers. The Weaving
      Maiden was the daughter of a Deity of Light. Her dwelling was upon the
      shore of the Milky Way, which is the Bright River of Heaven. All the day
      long she sat at her loom and plied her shuttle, weaving the gay garments
      of the gods. Warp and woof, hour by hour the coloured web grew till it lay
      fold on fold piled at her feet. Still she never ceased her labour, for she
      was afraid. She had heard a saying: “Sorrow, age-long sorrow, shall come
      upon the Weaving Maiden when she leaves her loom.” So she laboured, and
      the gods had garments to spare. But she herself, poor maiden, was
      ill-clad;she recked nothing of her attire or of the jewels that her father
      gave her. She went barefoot, and let her hair hang down unconfined. Ever
      and anon a long lock fell upon the loom, and back she flung it over her
      shoulder. She did not play with the children of Heaven, or take her
      pleasure with celestial youths and maidens. She did not love or weep. She
      was neither glad nor sorry. She sat weaving, weaving ... and wove her
      being into the many-coloured web. Now her father, the Deity of Light, grew
      angry. He said, “Daughter, you weave too much.” “It is my duty,” she said.
      “At your age to talk of duty!” said her father. “Out upon you!” “Wherefore
      are you displeased with me, my father?” she said, and her fingers plied
      the shuttle. “Are you a stock or a stone, or a pale flower by the
      wayside?” “Nay,” she said, “I am none of these.” “Then leave your loom, my
      child, and live; take your pleasure, be as others are.” “And wherefore
      should I be as others are?” she said. “Never dare to question me. Come,
      will you leave your loom?” She said, “Sorrow, age-long sorrow, shall come
      upon the Weaving Maiden when she leaves her loom.” “A foolish saying,”
      cried her father, “not worthy of credence. What do we know of age-long
      sorrow? Are we not gods?” With that he took her shuttle from her hand
      gently, and covered the loom with a cloth. And he caused her to be very
      richly attired, and they put jewels upon her and garlanded her head with
      flowers of Paradise. And her father gave her for spouse the Herd Boy of
      Heaven, who tended his flocks upon the banks of the Bright River. Now the
      Maiden was changed indeed. Her eyes were stars and her lips were ruddy.
      She went dancing and singing all the day. Long hours she played with the
      children of Heaven, and she took her pleasure with the celestial youths
      and maidens. Lightly she went; her feet were shod with silver. Her lover,
      the Herd Boy, held her by the hand. She laughed so that the very gods
      laughed with her, and High Heaven re-echoed with sounds of mirth. She was
      careless; little did she think of duty or of the garments of the gods. As
      for her loom, she never went near it from one moon’s end to another. “I
      have my life to live,” she said; “I’ll weave it into a web no more.”
    </p>
    <p>
      And the Herd Boy, her lover, clasped her in his arms. Her face was all
      tears and smiles, and she hid it on his breast. So she lived her life. But
      her father, the Deity of Light, was angry. “It is too much,” he said. “Is
      the girl mad? She will become the laughing-stock of Heaven. Besides, who
      is to weave the new spring garments of the gods?” Three times he warned
      his daughter. Three times she laughed softly and shook her head. “Your
      hand opened the door, my father,” she said, “but of a surety no hand
      either of god or of mortal can shut it.” He said, “You shall find it
      otherwise to your cost.” And he banished the Herd Boy for ever and ever to
      the farther side of the Bright River. The magpies flew together, from far
      and near, and they spread their wings for a frail bridge across the river,
      and the Herd Boy went over by the frail bridge. And immediately the
      magpies flew away to the ends of the earth and the Weaving Maiden could
      not follow. She was the saddest thing in Heaven. Long, long she stood upon
      the shore, and held out her arms to the Herd Boy, who tended his oxen
      desolate and in tears. Long, long she lay and wept upon the sand. Long,
      long she brooded, looking on the ground. She arose and went to her loom.
      She cast aside the cloth that covered it. She took her shuttle in her
      hand. “Age-long sorrow,” she said, “age-long sorrow!” Presently she
      dropped the shuttle. “Ah,” she moaned, “the pain of it,” and she leaned
      her head against the loom. But in a little while she said, “Yet I would
      not be as once I was. I did not love or weep, I was neither glad nor
      sorry. Now I love and I weep—I am glad, and I am sorry.” Her tears fell
      like rain, but she took up the shuttle and laboured diligently, weaving
      the garments of the gods. Sometimes the web was grey with grief, sometimes
      it was rosy with dreams. The gods were fain to go strangely clad. The
      Maiden’s father, the Deity of Light, for once was well pleased. “That is
      my good, diligent child,” he said. “Now you are quiet and happy.” “The
      quiet of dark despair,” she said. “Happy! I am the saddest thing in
      Heaven.” “I am sorry,” said the Deity of Light; “what shall I do?” “Give
      me back my lover.” “Nay, child, that I cannot do. He is banished for ever
      and ever by the decree of a Deity, that cannot be broken.” “I knew it,”
      she said. “Yet something I can do. Listen. On the seventh day of the
      seventh moon, I will summon the magpies together from the ends of the
      earth, and they shall be a bridge over the Bright River of Heaven, so that
      the Weaving Maiden shall lightly cross to the waiting Herd Boy on the
      farther shore.” So it was. On the seventh day of the seventh moon came the
      magpies from far and near. And they spread their wings for a frail bridge.
      And the Weaving Maiden went over by the frail bridge. Her eyes were like
      stars, and her heart like a bird in her bosom. And the Herd Boy was there
      to meet her upon the farther shore. And so it is still, oh, true
      lovers—upon the seventh day of the seventh moon these two keep their
      tryst. Only if the rain falls with thunder and cloud and hail, and the
      Bright River of Heaven is swollen and swift, the magpies cannot make a
      bridge for the Weaving Maiden. Alack, the dreary time! Therefore, true
      lovers, pray the gods for fair weather.

    <h3><a id="item5">The Five Boons of Life</a></h3>
    <em>A short story by Mark Twain</em><br />
    <p>
      <b>Chapter I</b> <br />
      In the morning of life came a good fairy with her basket, and said: "Here
      are gifts. Take one, leave the others. And be wary, chose wisely; oh,
      choose wisely! for only one of them is valuable." The gifts were five:
      Fame, Love, Riches, Pleasure, Death. The youth said, eagerly: "There is no
      need to consider"; and he chose Pleasure. He went out into the world and
      sought out the pleasures that youth delights in. But each in its turn was
      short-lived and disappointing, vain and empty; and each, departing, mocked
      him. In the end he said: "These years I have wasted. If I could but choose
      again, I would choose wisely.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Chapter II</b><br />
      The fairy appeared, and said: "Four of the gifts remain. Choose once more;
      and oh, remember-- time is flying, and only one of them is precious." The
      man considered long, then chose Love; and did not mark the tears that rose
      in the fairy's eyes. After many, many years the man sat by a coffin, in an
      empty home. And he communed with himself, saying: "One by one they have
      gone away and left me; and now she lies here, the dearest and the last.
      Desolation after desolation has swept over me; for each hour of happiness
      the treacherous trader, Love, as sold me I have paid a thousand hours of
      grief. Out of my heart of hearts I curse him."
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Chapter III</b><br />
      "Choose again." It was the fairy speaking. "The years have taught you
      wisdom--surely it must be so. Three gifts remain. Only one of them has any
      worth--remember it, and choose warily." The man reflected long, then chose
      Fame; and the fairy, sighing, went her way. Years went by and she came
      again, and stood behind the man where he sat solitary in the fading day,
      thinking. And she knew his thought: "My name filled the world, and its
      praises were on every tongue, and it seemed well with me for a little
      while. How little a while it was! Then came envy; then detraction; then
      calumny; then hate; then persecution. Then derision, which is the
      beginning of the end. And last of all came pity, which is the funeral of
      fame. Oh, the bitterness and misery of renown! target for mud in its
      prime, for contempt and compassion in its decay."
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Chapter IV</b><br />
      "Chose yet again." It was the fairy's voice. "Two gifts remain. And do not
      despair. In the beginning there was but one that was precious, and it is
      still here." "Wealth--which is power! How blind I was!" said the man.
      "Now, at last, life will be worth the living. I will spend, squander,
      dazzle. These mockers and despisers will crawl in the dirt before me, and
      I will feed my hungry heart with their envy. I will have all luxuries, all
      joys, all enchantments of the spirit, all contentments of the body that
      man holds dear. I will buy, buy, buy! deference, respect, esteem,
      worship--every pinchbeck grace of life the market of a trivial world can
      furnish forth. I have lost much time, and chosen badly heretofore, but let
      that pass; I was ignorant then, and could but take for best what seemed
      so." Three short years went by, and a day came when the man sat shivering
      in a mean garret; and he was gaunt and wan and hollow-eyed, and clothed in
      rags; and he was gnawing a dry crust and mumbling: "Curse all the world's
      gifts, for mockeries and gilded lies! And miscalled, every one. They are
      not gifts, but merely lendings. Pleasure, Love, Fame, Riches: they are but
      temporary disguises for lasting realities--Pain, Grief, Shame, Poverty.
      The fairy said true; in all her store there was but one gift which was
      precious, only one that was not valueless. How poor and cheap and mean I
      know those others now to be, compared with that inestimable one, that dear
      and sweet and kindly one, that steeps in dreamless and enduring sleep the
      pains that persecute the body, and the shames and griefs that eat the mind
      and heart. Bring it! I am weary, I would rest."
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Chapter V</b><br />
      The fairy came, bringing again four of the gifts, but Death was wanting.
      She said: "I gave it to a mother's pet, a little child. It was ignorant,
      but trusted me, asking me to choose for it. You did not ask me to choose."
      "Oh, miserable me! What is left for me?" "What not even you have deserved:
      the wanton insult of Old Age."
