# The `<body>` Tag

The `<body>` tags contains all sorts of visible texts, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists etc. within it.

Separate tags and syntax exists to add all these visible elements inside the `<body>` tags.

Some of such tags are :

- `<p> </p>` tags : For paragraphs
- `<br>` tag : For line break



## The `<p>` Tags

The `<p>` tags creates the paragraph spacing between the lines of text.

*For example :*

```HTML
<p>
  It was the hunter's first time outside Montana.
  He woke, stricken still with the hours-old vision of ascending through rose-lit cumulus,
  of houses and barns like specks deep in the snowed-in valleys.
</p>

<p>
  Now it was dark. The airplane descended over Chicago and finally they were down.
</p>
```

## The `<br>` Tag

The `<br>` tag don't have a closing tag and it simply breaks the line to start the next sentence on the next line.

Unlike the `<p>` tags, it don't creates a large spacing but, just creates a new line for the sentence.

*For example :*

```HTML
This is an awesome day to enjoy.<br>
There are so many flowers around us.<br>
Flowers are great.
```
